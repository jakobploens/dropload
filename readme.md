# Dropload

A bunch of tiny (3 kb minified) components for jQuery to handle drag and drop file uploads, focused on progessive enhancement and minimalism.

Honest readme: it's only tested in latest Safari, Chrome and Firefox so far. It's rough. Not very well documented. Basically this page is all there is. I'm not a JS guru/ninja, so this does not include the latest frontend bells and whistels. Feel free to play with it! Please don't expect support. Open source is hard!
